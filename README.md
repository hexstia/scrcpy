# scrcpy (v1.3)

This application provides display and control of Android devices connected on
USB (or [over TCP/IP][article-tcpip]). It does not require any _root_ access.
It works on _GNU/Linux_, _Windows_ and _MacOS_.

## Requirements

The Android part requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Make sure you [enabled adb debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).

## Get the app


### Linux

On Linux, you typically need to [build the app manually][BUILD]. Don't worry,
it's not that hard.

For Arch Linux, two [AUR] packages have been created by users:

 - [`scrcpy`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scrcpy/)
 - [`scrcpy-prebuiltserver`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scrcpy-prebuiltserver/)

[AUR]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository

For Gentoo, an [Ebuild] is available: [`scrcpy/`][ebuild-link].

[ebuild-link]: https://github.com/maggu2810/maggu2810-overlay/tree/master/app-mobilephone/scrcpy


### Windows

For Windows, for simplicity, prebuilt archives with all the dependencies
(including `adb`) are available:

 - [`scrcpy-win32-v1.3.zip`][direct-win32].  
   _(SHA-256: 51a2990e631ed469a7a86ff38107d517a91d313fb3f8327eb7bc71dde40870b5)_
 - [`scrcpy-win64-v1.3.zip`][direct-win64].  
   _(SHA-256: 0768a80d3d600d0bbcd220ca150ae88a3a58d1fe85c308a8c61f44480b711e43)_

[direct-win32]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/download/v1.3/scrcpy-win32-v1.3.zip
[direct-win64]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/download/v1.3/scrcpy-win64-v1.3.zip

You can also [build the app manually][BUILD].


### Mac OS

The application is available in [Homebrew]. Just install it:

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

```bash
brew install scrcpy
```

You need `adb`, accessible from your `PATH`. If you don't have it yet:

```bash
brew cask install android-platform-tools
```

You can also [build the app manually][BUILD].


## Run

Plug an Android device, and execute:

```bash
scrcpy
```

It accepts command-line arguments, listed by:

```bash
scrcpy --help
```

For example, to decrease video bitrate to 2Mbps (default is 8Mbps):

```bash
scrcpy -b 2M
```

To limit the video dimensions (e.g. if the device is 2540×1440, but the host
screen is smaller, or cannot decode such a high definition):

```bash
scrcpy -m 1024
```

The device screen may be cropped to mirror only part of the screen:

```bash
scrcpy -c 1224:1440:0:0   # 1224x1440 at offset (0,0)
```

If several devices are listed in `adb devices`, you must specify the _serial_:

```bash
scrcpy -s 0123456789abcdef
```

To show physical touches while scrcpy is running:

```bash
scrcpy -t
```

The app may be started directly in fullscreen:

```
scrcpy -f
```

## Why _scrcpy_?

A colleague challenged me to find a name as unpronounceable as [gnirehtet].

[`strcpy`] copies a **str**ing; `scrcpy` copies a **scr**een.
